<h1 align="center">Duplicate Game</h1>

Welcome to Duplicate. This game is a single-player matching game. The user will go through a set of cards and check if they are identical or not. There are 3 levels of difficulty including: easy, difficult and impossible (the changes (if there are any) are extremely inconspicuous in the impossible level). It is designed to test the very best and in some cases the difference is barely noticeable. 

The rules of the game is to simply identify if the pair of cards match or not and gain as many points as possible within 5 rounds.

The market audience is predominantly anybody who wants to play a game. The easy level mainly catering towards younger children under the age of 5, the difficult level is aimed at children upto the age of 10 and the impossible level has no age limit! Of course these ages are only guidlines and truly all levels can be played by anyone who dares to give it a go.

## User Experience (UX)
Users of the website will
* find a game with many levels and a text on landing page to choose a level.
* try different levels so the user spends more time playing the game
* try to figure out all possible pairs of images by repeating levels.
* find a variety of image pairs to avoid memorising the content

## Features
### Feature 1: Header
The header includes the title of the game using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) with two similar copy signs from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The copy signs are not exactly the same to show that they are not identical.  

### Feature 2: Difficulty Buttons
Directly below the header are the difficulty levels. 
- The user can hover over the button so that the user knows it is clickable. 
- The colour of the difficulty buttons are different shades of the main background colour (#EEA47FFF) and increase in saturation the higher the difficulty gets. 

### Feature 3: Question and Score Area
#### Question & Instruction
The game is fairly simple, are the images identical or not? Therefore, a question is added so the user can understand the game.
There is also an instruction which is one of the first things  
#### Score Area
The Score area is included so that the user can see the score they have obtained.  
#### Purchase
The online game can also have a corresponding card game which can be purchased on the link provided for Amazon. 

## Design 
* Throughout the entire game, predominantly only 2 colours have been used - #EEA47FFF for the background colour and #00539CFF for the text and header.
* The score area has the same colours but in the reverse order whereby #EEA47FFF is used for the text and #00539CFF is used for the background colour.
* The exception to the above however is the not identical and identical buttons. These are brightly red (#880808) and green (#228B22) respectively. This is to ensure contrast between background and to differentiate between these buttons and the difficulty level buttons. 
* All buttons have a hover feature which introduces a border and changes background colour. and the user can be sure of the button they have clicked on.
